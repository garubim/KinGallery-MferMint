KinGallery + MferMint: Poetry in the Machine
🎨 What This Is
A smart contract-based NFT platform that proves art and technology don't have to be extractive.

Every mint:

Honors the creator
Preserves history through cryptographic entanglement
Creates rarity through mathematical elegance
Writes poetry in the blockchain
🚀 Quick Start

Connect wallet (Smart Wallet or EOA)
Click Magic Button
Authorize transaction (8 seconds of animation)
Slide to page 2 (gallery)
See your mint entangled with its Legacy Mfer
🔗 The Entanglement System
How It Works
Every transaction hash creates a deterministic connection to an Ethereum Mfer:

// MagicMintButton.tsx
const lastSixHash = hash.slice(-6);          // e.g., "a3f7c2"
const lastSixNum = parseInt(lastSixHash, 16); // 10,752,706
const ethMferId = (lastSixNum % 9999) + 1;   // 2707

// Your Base Mfer #N is now forever entangled with Ethereum Mfer #2707
Collision Events (Rare Prestige)
If two mints would generate the same ethMferId (mathematically rare):

// First collision uses last 6 digits
if (hasCollision) {
  // Second collision uses first 6 digits instead
  const firstSixHash = hash.slice(2, 8);
  const collisionEthMferId = (parseInt(firstSixHash, 16) % 9999) + 1;
  
  // Sum both to reach original Mfers collection
  const originalMferNumber = (firstEthMferId + collisionEthMferId) % 10000;
  
  // Store in localStorage for future collision detection
  localStorage.setItem('mferMints', JSON.stringify(existingMints));
}
Result: 🌠 A rare event that creates prestige without power.

🎯 Key Features
1. No Extraction
// Every mint split automatically:
// 0.0002 ETH → Artist
// 0.0001 ETH → Gallery (creator support)
// (Uses safe .call{value:} pattern for smart wallets)
2. Cryptographic Entanglement
Deterministic: same hash → same number
Immutable: written to blockchain forever
Pseudo-random: appears random but reproducible
Connected: links Base NFT to Ethereum history
3. Narrative System
Each mint displays:

🎨 Your artwork (IPFS)
#️⃣ Edition number (tokenId)
🔗 Entangled Legacy Mfer (#N from Ethereum)
📅 Birth date (when you minted)
🔐 Certidão (transaction hash as proof)
🌠 Collision event (if rare enough)
4. Paymaster Integration
Uses Coinbase CDP Paymaster
Gas fees sponsored automatically
Works with EOA and Smart Wallets
Zero secrets in codebase

🎨 The UI Flow
Page 1: Welcome
[Magic Button spinning]
"Welcome to Connect"
  ↓ Click
[Wallet Modal]
Page 2: Login-to-Mint
Connected: 0xbcd9...4d
[Magic Button with new animation]
"LOGIN-to-MINT"
  ↓ Click
Page 3: Minting (8 seconds)
[Legacy-Mfer-Entanglement animation with spinning cubes]
[Loading overlay appears during wallet verification]
  ↓ After 8 seconds
[Slide-out animation to Page 2]
Page 4: Gallery (Your Mint)
Confetti animation (3s) + Mystery "🌀 Discovering entangled Mfer..."
  ↓ After 4s reveal
[Your artwork (Mfer)]
[Entanglement info: "Ethereum Mfer #N from original lineage (2021)"]
[Destiny message: "The soul spins at a base —"]
[Certidão section - hash, date, block, legacy Mfer]
[Collision event badge (if applicable)]

NOTE: Only interactive element = "view on basescan" link (small text under tx hash)
No action buttons - pure information display per Magic Button philosophy

🎓 Philosophy
This project embodies:

Artist-First Design - Technology serves the creator
Beauty Through Constraints - Limitations encode meaning
Narrative Over Speculation - Each mint tells a story
Poetic Code - Systems that read like poetry
Opposition to Greed - Explicit anti-extraction stance
"Here, we do things differently. Here, we write poetry in the machine."

🤝 Contributing
Before changing code, ask:

Does this honor the artist?
Does this add narrative?
Does this encode beauty or extraction?
Would this survive poetic scrutiny?
If the answer is yes to all: submit a PR.
